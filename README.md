## 🏗️ Project Architecture


GrindMap is built using a clear separation between **Frontend** and **Backend**, making
the project scalable, maintainable, and contributor-friendly.


### 🔙 Backend
---

The `backend/` directory handles all server-side responsibilities, including:

- Fetching and processing user data (e.g., coding platform stats)
- Scraping or integrating external platforms (like LeetCode, GitHub, etc.)
- Managing APIs that serve data to the frontend
- Handling business logic and data transformation

The backend acts as the **brain** of the system:
- It gathers raw data
- Cleans and structures it
- Exposes it through APIs for the frontend


### 🎨 Frontend
---
The `frontend/` directory is responsible for:

- User interface (UI)
- Visualizing streaks, progress, and consistency
- Displaying data received from backend APIs
- Providing interactive components for users

The frontend acts as the **face** of the system:
- It requests data from the backend
- Converts raw data into meaningful visuals
- Delivers a smooth and engaging user experience


### 🔄 Workflow Overview
---

High-level flow of the application:

1. User opens the web application (Frontend)
2. Frontend sends a request to the Backend API
3. Backend:
   - Fetches data from external platforms
   - Processes and structures the data
4. Backend returns processed data to the Frontend
5. Frontend:
   - Renders streaks, stats, and progress
   - Updates UI based on received data


### 💡 This architecture ensures
---
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier debugging and scaling
- Smooth onboarding for new contributors
